# Infrared-and-visible-video-fusion-method-based-on-inter-frame-feature-association-and-PID-control
In this paper, inter-frame feature correlation and proportional integral differential (PID) control are used for infrared and visible video fusion.
The simulation platform is based on MATLAB and the version must be higher than 2021a.
How to run:
In the get_weights folder, open main.slx, enter the samples, and simulate to get the optimal weights. The weights are saved in Weights.txt.
Copy Weights.txt. to the fusion folder and run main.m to get the fusion video.
